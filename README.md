# About

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Raghav, a Masters of Business Analytics candidate at MIT graduating in August 2024. I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of Professor Swati Gupta in the Operations Research Center in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital, applying machine learning in kidney transplant allocation.

I graduated with Highest Honors with a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2023. I worked as a research assistant in 2021 under the supervision of Professor Ahmet Coskun applying machine learning in prostate cancer. I also did a couple of internships at Abiomed and Flow MedTech as a Product Development Co-op and Engineering Intern respectively.

I am an aspiring data scientist passionate about applying machine learning to improve business decisions.

## **MIT Analytics Lab: Building CMA CGM's First AI-Powered Email Assistant**

**Background and Problem Statement**  
CMA CGM is the largest shipping company in the United States and handles more than 100k emails a week. However, they are currently processed manually by customer agents. There is a need for email classification and automating response generation to these emails.

**Proposed Solution**  
Built an AI email assistant that generates recommended replies to emails based on the task to be completed and further input from the customer agent. The assistant not only generates recommended replies to emails, but also provides an option for the customer agent to correct any categories the assistant might have miscategorized, enabling collection of feedback which can be used to further improve the responses.

**Actions**

**Impact**  
Projected to reduce time spent on email replies by 38.1%, leading to time savings of over 77k hours/year and $2.2M in productivity improvements/year.

**How would I approach problem now** <br>
Beyond the steps already taken, to further strengthen this project, I would try to establish a reliable method to measure the quality of the responses generated by the email assistant <br>
I would also consider using an ensemble similarity detection model to strengthen the reliability of the similar detection which is used my emails can be automated but don't fall under one of the identified categories.<br>
For this project, tasks by identified by manually looking at emails which can pose a scalaibility challenge when new emails of different categories enter and some categories could have been missed. Therefore, a method to more efficiently identify the task categories such as (delivery, rolling request etc) need to be devised.<br>

- Establish a reliable method to measure the quality of the responses generated by the email assistant.

- Consider using an ensemble similarity detection model to strengthen the reliability of the similarity detection, especially for emails that don't fall under one of the identified categories.

- Devise a more efficient method to identify task categories, such as delivery or rolling requests, to address scalability challenges posed by manually identifying tasks and potential missed categories when new emails of different categories enter the system.
